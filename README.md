# **MIMIC-III Data Analysis with Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

## **üìå Overview**
This project demonstrates how to analyze **MIMIC-III healthcare data** using **Google BigQuery, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)** models. The tutorial is designed for **Google Colab** and covers data extraction, preprocessing, and predictive modeling for ICU patient outcomes. 

This project is part of the **AI in Healthcare** class and aims to provide insights into patient outcome predictions using real-world clinical data.

## **üìä Project Steps**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to Google BigQuery & Extract MIMIC-III Data**
- Authenticate Google Cloud account.
- Query **MIMIC-III clinical data** (ICD-9 procedures, vitals, and patient demographics).
- Handle missing values and ensure data integrity.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Encode categorical features (e.g., gender).
- Normalize continuous features (age, heart rate, blood pressure).
- Split dataset into **training and testing sets**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Train Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression)**
- Train a **Logistic Regression model** for mortality prediction.
- Handle class imbalance using `class_weight='balanced'`.
- Evaluate model using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Train Deep Learning Model (Neural Network)**
- Use **TensorFlow/Keras** to build a **multi-layer neural network**.
- Include **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate model performance on **validation data**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizations & Model Insights**
- Plot **accuracy and loss curves** for deep learning training.
- Generate **boxplots for age distribution by procedure type**.
- Display **model evaluation metrics**.

## **üîß Requirements**
Ensure that the following libraries are installed:
```bash
!pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn google-cloud-bigquery
```

---

## **üöÄ How to Run the Notebook**
1. **Open Google Colab**.
2. **Upload `MIMIC_Tutorial_Colab.ipynb`**.
3. **Authenticate Google Cloud & Enable BigQuery**:
   ```python
   from google.colab import auth
   auth.authenticate_user()
   ```
4. **Run all cells step-by-step** to extract data, preprocess, train models, and visualize results.
